 *
 * Name:        demod_9600_process_sample
 *
 * Purpose:     (1) Filter & slice the signal.
 *		(2) Descramble it.
 *		(2) Recover clock and data.
 *
 * Inputs:	chan	- Audio channel.  0 for left, 1 for right.
 *
 *		sam	- One sample of audio.
 *			  Should be in range of -32768 .. 32767.
 *
 * Returns:	None 
 *
 * Descripion:	"9600 baud" packet is FSK for an FM voice transceiver.
 *		By the time it gets here, it's really a baseband signal.
 *		At one extreme, we could have a 4800 Hz square wave.
 *		A the other extreme, we could go a considerable number
 *		of bit times without any transitions.
 *
 *		The trick is to extract the digital data which has
 *		been distorted by going thru voice transceivers not
 *		intended to pass this sort of "audio" signal.
 *
 *		Data is "scrambled" to reduce the amount of DC bias.
 *		The data stream must be unscrambled at the receiving end.
 *
 *		We also have a digital phase locked loop (PLL)
 *		to recover the clock and pick out data bits at
 *		the proper rate.
 *
 *		For each recovered data bit, we call:
 *
 *			  hdlc_rec (channel, demodulated_bit);
 *
 *		to decode HDLC frames from the stream of bits.
 *
 * Future:	This could be generalized by passing in the name
 *		of the function to be called for each bit recovered
 *		from the demodulator.  For now, it's simply hard-coded.

 * TODO:	This works in a simulated environment but it has not yet
 *		been successfully tested for interoperability with 
 *		other systems over the air.
 *		That's why it is not mentioned in documentation.
 *
 *		The signal from the radio speaker does NOT have 
 *		enough bandwidth and the waveform is hopelessly distorted.
 *		It will be necessary to obtain a signal right after
 *		the discriminator of the receiver.
 *		It will probably also be necessary to tap directly into
 *		the modulator, bypassing the microphone amplifier.
