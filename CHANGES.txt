Revision history
----------------


-----------
Version 1.0a	May 2014
-----------

* Bug fix:

Beacons sent directly to IGate server had incorrect source address.



-----------
Version 1.0	May 2014
-----------

* New Features:

Received audio can be obtained with a UDP socket or stdin.
This can be used to take audio from software defined radios
such as rtl_fm or gqrx.

9600 baud data rate.

New PBEACON and OBEACON configuration options. Previously
it was necessary to handcraft beacons. 

Less CPU power required for 300 baud.  This is important
if you want to run a bunch of decoders at the same time
to tolerate off-frequency HF SSB signals.

Improved support for UTF-8 character set.

Improved troubleshooting display for APRStt macros.



-----------
Version 0.9	November 2013
-----------

* New Features:

Selection of non-default audio device for Linux ALSA.

Simplified audio device set up for Raspberry Pi.

GPIO lines can be used for PTT on suitable Linux systems.

Improved 1200 baud decoder.

Multiple decoders per channel to tolerate HF SSB signals off frequency.

Command line option "-t 0" to disable text colors.

APRStt macros which allow short numeric only touch tone
sequences to be processed as much longer predefined sequences.



* Bugs Fixed:

Now works on 64 bit target.



* New Restriction for Windows version:

Minimum processor is now Pentium 3 or equivalent or later.
It's possible to run on something older but you will need
to rebuild it from source.




-----------
Version 0.8	August 2013
-----------

* New Features:

Internet Gateway (IGate) including IPv6 support.

Compatibility with YAAC.

Preemptive digipeating option.

KISS TNC should now work with connected AX.25 protocols
(e.g. AX25 for Linux), not just APRS.



-----------
Version 0.7	March 2013
-----------

* New Features:

Added APRStt gateway capability.  For details, see:

APRStt-Implementation-Notes.pdf




-----------
Version 0.6
-----------


* New Features:

Improved performance of AFSK demodulator.
Now decodes 965 frames from Track 2 of WA8LMF’s TNC Test CD.

KISS protocol now available thru a TCP socket.
Default port is 8001.
Change it with KISSPORT option in configuration file.

Ability to salvage frames with bad FCS.
See section mentioning "bad apple" in the user guide.
Default of fixing 1 bit works well.  
Fixing more bits not recommended because there is a high
probability of occasional corrupted data getting thru.

Added AGW "monitor" format messages.
Now compatible with APRS-TW for telemetry.


* Bugs Fixed:

None.



* Known Problem:

The Linux (but not Cygwin) version eventually hangs if nothing is
reading from the KISS pseudo terminal.  Some operating system
queue fills up, the application write blocks, and decoding stops.


* Workaround:

If another application is not using the serial KISS interface,
run this in another window:

	tail -f /tmp/kisstnc


-----------
Version 0.5
-----------


More error checking and messages for invalid APRS data.


-----------
Version 0.4
-----------

First general availability.
