 *
 * Module:      xmit.c
 *
 * Purpose:   	Transmit queued up packets when channel is clear.
 *		
 * Description:	Producers of packets to be transmitted call tq_append and then
 *		go merrily on their way, unconcerned about when the packet might
 *		actually get transmitted.
 *
 *		This thread waits until the channel is clear and then removes
 *		packets from the queue and transmits them.
 *
 *
 * Usage:	(1) The main application calls xmit_init.
 *
 *			This will initialize the transmit packet queue
 *			and create a thread to empty the queue when
 *			the channel is clear.
 *
 *		(2) The application queues up packets by calling tq_append.
 *
 *			Packets that are being digipeated should go in the 
 *			high priority queue so they will go out first.
 *
 *			Other packets should go into the lower priority queue.
 *
 *		(3) xmit_thread removes packets from the queue and transmits
 *			them when other signals are not being heard.

 *
 * Description:	Initialize the queue to be empty and set up other
 *		mechanisms for sharing it between different threads.
 *
 *		We have different timing rules for different types of
 *		packets so they are put into different queues.
 *
 *		High Priority -
 *
 *			Packets which are being digipeated go out first.
 *			Latest recommendations are to retransmit these
 *			immdediately (after no one else is heard, of course)
 *			rather than waiting random times to avoid collisions.
 *			The KPC-3 configuration option for this is "UIDWAIT OFF".  (?)
 *
 *		Low Priority - 
 *
 *			Other packets are sent after a random wait time
 *			(determined by PERSIST & SLOTTIME) to help avoid
 *			collisions.	
 *
 *		If more than one audio channel is being used, a separate
 *		pair of transmit queues is used for each channel.
 *
 *
 * Thought for future research:
 *
 *		Should we send multiple frames in one transmission if we 
 *		have more than one sitting in the queue?  At first I was thinking
 *		this would help reduce channel congestion.  I don't recall seeing
 *		anything in the specifications allowing or disallowing multiple
 *		frames in one transmission.  I can think of some scenarios 
 *		where it might help.  I can think of some where it would 
 *		definitely be counter productive.  
 *		For now, one frame per transmission.
 *
 * What to others have to say about this topic?
 *
 *	"For what it is worth, the original APRSdos used a several second random
 *	generator each time any kind of packet was generated... This is to avoid
 *	bundling. Because bundling, though good for connected packet, is not good
 *	on APRS. Sometimes the digi begins digipeating the first packet in the
 *	bundle and steps all over the remainder of them. So best to make sure each
 *	packet is isolated in time from others..."
 *	
 *		Bob, WB4APR
 *	
 *
 * Version 0.9:	Earlier versions always sent one frame per transmission.
 *		This was fine for APRS but more and more people are now
 *		using this as a KISS TNC for connected protocols.
 *		Rather than having a MAXFRAME configuration file item,
 *		we try setting the maximum number automatically.
 *		1 for digipeated frames, 7 for others.
