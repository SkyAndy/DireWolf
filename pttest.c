 *
 * Module:      pttest.c
 *
 * Purpose:   	Test for pseudo terminal.
 *		
 * Input:	
 *
 * Outputs:	  
 *
 * Description:	The protocol name is an acronym for Keep it Simple Stupid.
 *		You would expect it to be simple but this caused a lot
 *		of effort on Linux.  The problem is that writes to a pseudo
 *		terminal eventually block if nothing at the other end 
 *		is removing the data.  This causes the application to
 *		hang and stop receiving after a while.
 *
 *		This is an attempt to demonstrate the problem in a small
 *		test case and, hopefully, find a solution.
 *	
 *
 * Instructions:
 *		First compile like this:
 *
 *
 *		Run it, noting the name of pseudo terminal, 
 *		typically /dev/pts/1.
 *
 *		In another window, type:
 *
 *			cat /dev/pts/1
 *
 *		This should run "forever" as long as something is
 *		reading from the slave side of the pseudo terminal.
 *
 *		If nothing is removing the data, this runs for a while
 *		and then blocks on the write.
 *		For this particular application we just want to discard
 *		excess data if no one is listening.
 *
 *
 * Failed experiments:
 *
 * 		Notice that ??? always returns 0 for amount of data
 *		in the queue.  
 *		Define TEST1 to make the device non-blocking.
 *		Write fails entirely.
 *
 *		Define TEST2 to use a different method.
 *		Also fails in the same way.
 *
